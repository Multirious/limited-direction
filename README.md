# limited-direction

My algorithm that find path to any direction and distance but with limited directions
Seems to be support multiple directions but I'm not sure what is not supported.
And I doesn't really know if this algorithm has already been made.
I just can't find anything else on the internet so I made one.

Read the code of the example to see keybindings.

`cargo run --example visualize` to see visualization

`cargo run --example snowflake` to see visualize multiple angle at once (It's kinda beautiful)
